- getNeighboursSquares() function complexity is yellow, need more time to refactor it
- getNumberOfNeighbourBombs() function complexity is yellow, need more time to refactor it
- getPossibleSteps() function complexity is yellow, need more time to refactor it
- makeStep() function doesn't cover cases when clicking on square with 0 neighbour bombs and it should show all the neighbours on the gameboard
- makeStep() function: when 1 bomb around square message says 1 bombs... instead of 1 bomb....
- markSquare() function is implemented, but couldn't figure out how to add to the gamePlay() fucntion
- playGame() function has uncovered lines depending game result win or lose
