# Mine Sweeper kata - Yellow belt exam

```text
Mine Sweeper - Game	Rules:
You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. If you step
on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to clear all the squares (without clicking on any
bombs) you win.
Clearing a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs.
If you guess a square contains a bomb mark it with a flag.
A squares "neighbours" are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals. Squares on the
sides of the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors. The board does not wrap around the edges. If you
clear a square with 0 neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will automatically open; recursively.
The first square you open could be a bomb.
You don't have to mark all the bombs to win; you just need to open all non-bomb squares

Kata Objective:
The game runs in BOT mode to print on the screen all the moves until we got a victory or game over. The test
suite can simulate the game without having an executable. In that case the test suite will print on console
the scenario; or in a log file with a clean test report [red/green style]
```
